# PR #32 Remediation Plan

## Issue Summary
PR #32 is a Renovate bot security update for `github.com/go-jose/go-jose/v4` from v4.0.4 to v4.0.5 to fix CVE-2025-27144 (a DoS vulnerability from excessive memory consumption when parsing malformed JWT tokens).

## Failed Check Analysis
The failing check is the "renovate/artifacts" check, which indicates an artifact file update failure. Based on the GitHub Actions log analysis:

### Primary Failure Point
- **Step**: `prepare upstream` (make upstream)
- **Error**: `make: *** No rule to make target 'upstream'. Stop.`
- **Exit Code**: 2

### Secondary Issues
- **Missing dependency**: `pulumictl: command not found` 
- **Cache service failures**: "Failed to restore: Cache service responded with 400" and "Failed to save" due to GitHub service outage

## Root Cause
1. **Missing Makefile target**: The workflow attempts to run `make upstream` but this target doesn't exist in the current Makefile
2. **Missing pulumictl**: The command `pulumictl` is not available in the CI environment but is referenced in the VERSION variable and other targets

## Recommended Fix Actions

### 1. Add Missing Makefile Target
Add an `upstream` target to the Makefile that handles upstream dependency preparation, likely related to updating the terraform provider version.

### 2. Install pulumictl in CI
Ensure the GitHub Actions workflow installs `pulumictl` before attempting to use it.

### 3. Update CI Workflow
The CI workflow needs to be updated to handle the missing dependencies and tools required for the build process.

### 4. Verify go.mod Updates
After the security update is merged, verify that `go.mod` and `go.sum` are properly updated with the new dependency versions.

## Implementation Priority
- **High**: Fix the missing `upstream` target
- **High**: Install pulumictl in CI pipeline
- **Medium**: Address cache service issues (may be transient GitHub issues)
- **Low**: Update documentation if needed

## Expected Outcome
Once fixed, the security update should merge cleanly, updating the go-jose dependency to address the CVE while maintaining all existing functionality.

## Files to Modify
- `Makefile` - Add upstream target
- `.github/workflows/*.yml` - Install pulumictl
- Potentially `provider/go.mod` - Verify dependency updates
