# GitHub Actions Workflow Failures - Remediation Plan

## Analysis Summary
Recent workflow runs have been failing consistently due to Go dependency issues. All failures are in the `prerequisites` job during the "Build tfgen & provider binaries" step.

## Root Cause
**Missing go.sum entries** for various `golang.org/x/*` packages, specifically:
- `golang.org/x/crypto/*` (multiple subpackages: sha3, hkdf, argon2, cryptobyte, cast5, pbkdf2, bcrypt, ssh)
- `golang.org/x/net/*` (http2, context, trace)  
- `golang.org/x/oauth2/*` (jwt, google, base package)

## Secondary Issue
Cache restoration is failing because `go.sum` file is missing from the repository root.

## Remediation TODO List

### Priority 1: Fix Go Dependencies
1. **Run `go mod tidy`** to regenerate go.sum with all required module entries
2. **Verify go.mod and go.sum** are both committed to repository
3. **Test locally** that `make development` and `make provider` work without errors

### Priority 2: Validate Build Process  
4. **Run full build locally** using the same commands as CI (`make tfgen`, `make provider`)
5. **Check for any additional missing dependencies** during local build
6. **Ensure all imported packages** have corresponding go.sum entries

### Priority 3: Test CI Pipeline
7. **Create test branch** and push to trigger CI workflow
8. **Verify prerequisites job** completes successfully
9. **Confirm build_sdk and test jobs** can run without dependency errors

### Priority 4: Prevent Future Issues
10. **Add go.sum validation** to local development workflow
11. **Document dependency update process** in CONTRIBUTING.md
12. **Consider adding pre-commit hooks** to ensure go.sum is always up-to-date

## Affected Workflow Runs
- Run #16715270509 (most recent failure)
- Run #16715227589 
- Run #16715179314
- Multiple other recent runs with same pattern

## Next Steps
Start with Priority 1 items, then validate each fix before proceeding to the next priority level.
